A reproducibility study which aimed to investigate findings regarding recommender system bias in the movie domain for songs has been chosen to be reproduced. The challenges of setting up a suitable environment for the reproduction of the obtained results was non-trivial due to unclear versioning and partly undocumented data pre-processing steps. The original analysis performed by the analyzed authors was verified further by using cross validation for significance testing and reconstructing the describe data sampling approach. The findings described in the analyzed publication were successfully validated and reproduced.

This project was performed as a part of a the lecture "Experiment Design for Data Science" at the Technical University of Vienna (TU Wien). The goal of this project is the investigate the reproducibility of a specific publication.
