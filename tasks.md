# Tasks for Assignment 2

## 1 - Taskoverview

The following tasks need to be done to finish the exercise:

- Check the available material
    - Read the papers
    - Try to run the code
- Identify the experimental setup
    - Identify the experimental setup using the papers as well as the provided code
        - What is the main concern of the work?
            *Popularity bias in recommender systems*
        - What dataset has been used?
            *The LFM-1B dataset for music retrieval and recommendation. In:Proceedings of the 2016 ACM on International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval*
        - How was the data sampled?
        - How was the data preprocessed?
        - Which experiments were performed? Give a reason why a given experiment was performed.
        - Specify the experimental setups as detailed as possible unsing the information from the paper.
        - Supplement the experimental setups using the code.
    - Identify missing/faulty steps in the experimental setup and give a reason for identifying them as such
        - Are there any problems with the dataset itself?
        - Is there something wrong with sampling method used?
        - Are there missing/faulty preprocessing steps? Give a reason for identifying them as such.
        - Is the reason for performing the experiments valid?
        - Are there missing/faulty steps in the experimental setup? Give a reason for identifying them as such.
    - Add missing steps / replace faulty steps in the experimental setup and give a reason for the choices made
- Identify the result analysis setup
    - Identify the result analysis setup using the papers as well as the provided code
        - Which parts of the results have been analyzed? Give a reason why a given result subset has been selected.
        - How were the results tranformed? (eg. log transform)
        - How were the results interpreted?
        - Which statistical tests have been performed in order to show the significance of the results?
    - Identify missing/faulty steps in the result analysis setup and give a reason for identifying them as such?
        - Are the results presented realy relevant?
        - Does the chosen transformation make sense?
        - Does the result interpretation make sense?
        - Are the chosen statistical tests applicable to the analysed results?
    - Add missing steps / replace faulty steps in the experimental setup and give a reason for the choices made
- Prepare intermediate Presentation
    - Prepare an introduction slide stating the chosen topic and the groupmembers
    - Prepare two slides stating the work already done. The following tasks should be mentioned:
        - Identification of the experimental setup
        - Identification of the result analysis setup
    - Prepare two slides stating the work that still has to be done. The following tasks should be mentioned:
        - Experiment execution
        - Result analysis
        - Report production
- Execute the experiment
- Result analysis
- Write a Report
- Submission
    - Submit the report to zenodo (https://zenodo.org/deposit/new?c=tuw-exdds-ws21)
    - Tuwel Submission
        - Provide the DOI pointing to you report
        - Prodide the experimentation scripts/code/workflows
